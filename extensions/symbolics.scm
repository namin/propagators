;;; The old school method is annoying because one needs to maintain a
;;; complete list of all the generic operations one might want to
;;; augment, and it doesn't really scale to applications like teaching
;;; car to handle TMSes.  On the other hand, the new school method is
;;; annoying because it's asymmetric in the arguments (there's no good
;;; way to say "if either argument is nothing, don't bother me"), and
;;; because repacked but not yet flattened structures often seem to
;;; violate that data type's invariants.  TMSes and symbolic
;;; expressions are a case in point: they are not written to handle
;;; having a nothing for payload, but generic-unpack shoves it right
;;; in so that generic-flatten can take it back out again.  Maybe this
;;; is why Haskell chose bind as the fundamental monadic operation.

;;; The asymmetry can be largely solved by defining
;;; generic-binary-unpack (which is used inside a binary bind,
;;; followed by the same flatten).

;;; The new school method also has the problem that it isn't really
;;; very good for the comparison operators, because this data type is
;;; really only applicable to numbers, not to boolean values (unless I
;;; change it to be applicable to boolean values too...)
