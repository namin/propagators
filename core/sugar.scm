;;;; Carcinogens for the semicolon part 2: Defining propagators

;;; Here be macros that provide syntactic sugar for playing with the
;;; propagator language as embedded in Scheme.  Syntactic regularities
;;; in patterns of definition of propagator constructors are captured.

;;;; Paired propagator definitions

;;; Propagator objects are usually defined in pairs, one preferring to
;;; be applied diagram-style, and one preferring to be applied
;;; expression-style.  These two macros define such pairs of
;;; propagator objects, with the given names.  Said names are
;;; presumably computed by PROPAGATOR-NAMING-CONVENTION, below

(define-syntax define-by-diagram-variant
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((define-by-diagram-variant (diagram-name expression-name) form)
     (begin
       (define-cell diagram-name form)
       (define-cell expression-name
	 (expression-style-variant diagram-name))))))

(define-syntax define-by-expression-variant
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((define-by-diagram-variant (diagram-name expression-name) form)
     (begin
       (define-cell expression-name form)
       (define-cell diagram-name
	 (diagram-style-variant expression-name))))))

;;;; Propagator naming convention

;;; The naming convention is:
;;;   p:foo   the propagator version of foo
;;;   e:foo   the expression-style variant of p:foo
;;;   c:foo   the constraint-propagator version of foo
;;;   ce:foo  the expression-style variant of c:foo

;;; For convenience, this convention includes constraint-propagator
;;; versions of the various propagators.  The procedure
;;; PROPAGATOR-NAMING-CONVENTION is a macro-helper; it constructs a
;;; pair of names derived from the given name, one to name the
;;; diagram-style variant and one to name the expression-style
;;; variant.  This is calibrated for use with
;;; DEFINE-BY-DIAGRAM-VARIANT and DEFINE-BY-EXPRESSION-VARIANT, above.

(define (propagator-naming-convention name)
  (let* ((name-string (symbol->string name))
	 (long-named? (and (>= (string-length name-string) 3)
			   (equal? "ce:" (substring name-string 0 3))))

;;;; Defining primitive propagators

;;; The PROPAGATIFY macro automates the process of defining extensible
;;; propagators whose basic operations are Scheme procedures.

;;; FUNCTION->PROPAGATOR-CONSTRUCTOR turns Scheme procedures into
;;; propagator constructors (that make primitive propagators).  In
;;; principle, that's good enough; but two things can be done to make
;;; the resulting propagator easier to extend to different partial
;;; information structures.  First, a generic operation can be defined
;;; and second, the nary-mapping wrapper from generic-definitions.scm
;;; can be applied.  Finally, to complete the definition, an
;;; expression version of the propagator constructor is usually
;;; defined.  PROPAGATIFY does these things:
;;;   (propagatify +)
;;; is equivalent to
;;;   (define generic-+ (make-generic-operator 2 '+ +))
;;;   (define-cell p:+
;;;     (function->propagator-constructor (nary-mapping generic-+)))
;;;   (define-cell e:+ (expression-style-variant p:+))

;;; Note that the generic machinery needs to know the arity of the
;;; generic operation to define.  PROPAGATIFY will make an educated
;;; guess for what that arity should be, but an explicit second
;;; argument can be supplied to fix the arity.  In addition, if the
;;; second argument is present but is not an arity, PROPAGATIFY will
;;; interpret that as a request not to define the generic procedure at
;;; all.  So
;;;   (propagatify + 'no-generic)
;;; would be equivalent to
;;;   (define-cell p:+ (function->propagator-constructor (nary-mapping +)))
;;;   (define-cell e:+ (expression-style-variant p:+))

;;; Finally, sometimes it is appropriate to propagatify a Scheme
;;; procedure directly, without any provision for extensibility.  The
;;; PROPAGATIFY-RAW macro is helpful for this.
;;;   (propagatify-raw +)
;;; would be equivalent to
;;;   (define-cell p:+ (function->propagator-constructor +))
;;;   (define-cell e:+ (expression-style-variant p:+)
;;; Compare (propagatify + 'no-generic).

;;;; Defining "propagator macros"

;;; Scheme is the macro language of this embedded propagator system.
;;; Therefore defining "propagator macros" is just a matter of
;;; defining Scheme procedures.  Some patterns are common, however, so
;;; merit a little macro support.

;;; DEFINE-PROPAGATOR-SYNTAX is (meant to be) just like define, except
;;; that it wraps the body being defined in a WITH-NETWORK-GROUP,
;;; which is a hook for tagging all cells and propagators created
;;; inside the call with a common identity, which can then be passed
;;; on to the graph drawing tools used to inspect the network.
;;; DEFINE-PROPAGATOR-SYNTAX also assigns the formal parameter names
;;; as names to the incoming arguments.  The latter is most useful in
;;; the regime where all the passed arguments are actually cells (as
;;; opposed to, say, Scheme-lists of cells).
