;;;; Carcinogens for the semicolon part 1: Defining cells

;;; Here be macros that provide syntactic sugar for playing with the
;;; propagator language as embedded in Scheme.  Syntactic regularities
;;; in patterns of definition of cells are captured.

;; (define-cell foo form)
;; is the same as
;; (define foo (ensure-cell form))
;; except it grabs the name foo and associates it with the
;; cell that form constructs.
;;
;; For the frequent case when you want a fresh cell
;; (define-cell foo)
;; expands into
;; (define-cell foo (make-named-cell 'foo))
;; The metadata is then available two ways.

(define-syntax define-cell
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((define-cell symbol form)
     (define symbol (name-locally! (ensure-cell form) 'symbol)))
    ((define-cell symbol)
     (define-cell symbol (make-named-cell 'symbol)))))

;; (let-cells ((foo foo-form)
;;             (bar bar-form)
;;             (baz baz-form))
;;   stuff)
;; is the same as 
;; (let ((foo (ensure-cell foo-form))
;;       (bar (ensure-cell bar-form))
;;       (baz (ensure-cell baz-form)))
;;   stuff)
;; except that it captures the names foo bar and baz and associates
;; them with the cells that the corresponding forms return.
;;
;; For the frequent case when you want fresh cells
;; (let-cells (foo bar baz)
;;   stuff)
;; expands into
;; (let-cells ((foo (make-named-cell 'foo))
;;             (bar (make-named-cell 'bar))
;;             (baz (make-named-cell 'baz)))
;;   stuff)
;; The metadata is then available two ways.

;; The following would suffice for the above:
#;
 (define-syntax let-cells
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((let-cells ((name form) ...)
	form ...)
      (let ((name (name-locally! (ensure-cell form) 'name)) ...)
	form ...))
     ((let-cells (name ...)
	form ...)
      (let-cells ((name (make-named-cell 'name))...)
	form ...))))

;; The much more horrible LET-CELLS macro below allows the two use
;; patterns above to mix, as follows,
;; (let-cells ((foo foo-form)
;;             bar
;;             (baz baz-form))
;;   stuff)
;; and have the right thing happen.  It also interprets the
;; slightly more traditional
;; (let-cells ((foo foo-form)
;;             (bar)
;;             (baz baz-form))
;;   stuff)
;; in agreement with Scheme's let.
